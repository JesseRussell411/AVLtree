# AVLtree
AVL balanced binary search tree writen in java. This was for csci232 (data structures and algorithms) at Montana State University. Driver contains a simple user interface for testing. You can store and remove key-value pairs. To "put" a key value pair into the tree enter: p {some number} {some string}. the number is the key and the string is the value. It should look like this: p 4 "dog". The rest of the commands should be mostly self-explanatory, like g 4 will return "dog" if entered after the put command.  
Compile: javac Driver.java  
Run: java Driver
